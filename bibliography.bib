annote  = {This is a popular algorithms textbook which is well-cited. In particular, Part VI on graph algorithms will be of interest. Chapter 26 discusses flow networks and introduces commonly used notation. It formally describes the problem of obtaining a maximum flow and its equivalence to obtaining a minimum cut. The classical method of Ford and Fulkerson's algorithm for finding a maximum flow is described, and it includes several examples. Additional methods for obtaining a maximum flow, including the push-relabel method, are also described. The chapter notes include additional references to specific articles which may be helpful, such as those of historical interest (the article in which an algorithm was originally proposed) as well as state-of-the-art improvements (more recent articles to improve the approach).}

abstract = {Domestic undergraduate computer science students formally learn about machine learning and artificial intelligence in upper level undergraduate computing programs, yet they must navigate the lure of ChatGPT and other generative Artificial Intelligence tools that have been found to be somewhat accurate at completing early coding assignments. As AI tools proliferate, messaging about their use in academic settings are varied, and access to AI literacy is unknown. Through an investigation of interviews with Pell grant eligible college students at open access colleges, we address the following research questions: How do low-income undergraduate interview participants describe their uses of and attitudes regarding generative AI tool use for academic purposes? and What elements of AI digital literacy appear to be accessible to interview participants, based on their descriptive statements?},

abstract = {To reflect the importance of network technologies, networking courses are now part of the core materials of Computer Science degrees. We report our experience in jointly developing an open-source ebook for the introductory course, and a series of open educational resources for both the introductory and advanced networking courses. These ensure students actively engage with the course materials, through a hands-on approach; and scale to the larger classrooms and limited teaching staff, by leveraging open-source resources and an automated grading platform to provide feedback. We evaluate the impact of these pedagogical innovations by surveying the students, who indicated that these were helpful for them to master the course materials.},

Most of the practical use of this paper is to reference larger scale free textbooks for each of the listed sections, making a pool of resources for students to use and learn from the listed authors. The paper also dives deeper into the overarching topics professors should be covering, such as Learning protocols by dissecting packets, running virtual labs, implementing a simple transport protocol, and much more.}
