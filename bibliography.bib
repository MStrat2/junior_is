annote  = {This is a popular algorithms textbook which is well-cited. In particular, Part VI on graph algorithms will be of interest. Chapter 26 discusses flow networks and introduces commonly used notation. It formally describes the problem of obtaining a maximum flow and its equivalence to obtaining a minimum cut. The classical method of Ford and Fulkerson's algorithm for finding a maximum flow is described, and it includes several examples. Additional methods for obtaining a maximum flow, including the push-relabel method, are also described. The chapter notes include additional references to specific articles which may be helpful, such as those of historical interest (the article in which an algorithm was originally proposed) as well as state-of-the-art improvements (more recent articles to improve the approach).}

abstract = {Domestic undergraduate computer science students formally learn about machine learning and artificial intelligence in upper level undergraduate computing programs, yet they must navigate the lure of ChatGPT and other generative Artificial Intelligence tools that have been found to be somewhat accurate at completing early coding assignments. As AI tools proliferate, messaging about their use in academic settings are varied, and access to AI literacy is unknown. Through an investigation of interviews with Pell grant eligible college students at open access colleges, we address the following research questions: How do low-income undergraduate interview participants describe their uses of and attitudes regarding generative AI tool use for academic purposes? and What elements of AI digital literacy appear to be accessible to interview participants, based on their descriptive statements?},

We report our experience in jointly developing an open-source ebook for the introductory course, and a series of open educational resources for both the introductory and advanced networking courses. These ensure students actively engage with the course materials, through a hands-on approach; and scale to the larger classrooms and limited teaching staff, by leveraging open-source resources and an automated grading platform to provide feedback. We evaluate the impact of these pedagogical innovations by surveying the students, who indicated that these were helpful for them to master the course materials.},

The paper also dives deeper into the overarching topics professors should be covering, such as Learning protocols by dissecting packets, running virtual labs, implementing a simple transport protocol, and much more.}

abstract = {We propose moving from Software Defined Networks (SDN) to Software Managed Networks (SMN) where all information for managing the life cycle of a network (from deployment to operations to upgrades), across all layers (from Layer 1 through 7) is stored in a central repository. Crucially, a SMN also has a generalized control plane that, unlike SDN, controls all aspects of the cloud including traffic management (e.g., capacity planning) and reliability (e.g., incident routing) at both short (minutes) and large (years) time scales. Just as SDN allows better routing, a SMN improves visibility and enables cross-layer optimizations for faster response to failures and better network planning and operations. Implemented naively, SMN for planetary sc6ale networks requires orders of magnitude larger and more heterogeneous data (e.g., alerts, logs) than SDN. We address this using coarsening — mapping complex data to a more compact abstract representation that has approximately the same effect, and is more scalable, maintainable, and learnable. We show examples including Coarse Bandwidth Logs for capacity planning and Coarse Dependency Graphs for incident routing. Coarse Dependency Graphs improve an incident routing metric from 45\% to 78\% while for a distributed approach like Scouts the same metric was 22\%. We end by discussing how to realize SMN, and suggest cross-layer optimizations and coarsenings for other operational and planning problems in networks.},

It gives examples for the weaknesses of Siloed Network management (A practice where work is divided up by working on different TCP/IP layers) and how SDNs still do not allow for the best management of all layers. It continues into the deeper workings of SMNs via Coarsening (The idea of mapping complex data to a more compact and abstract representation that has approximately the same effect.)}
