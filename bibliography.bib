abstract = {To reflect the importance of network technologies, networking courses are now part of the core materials of Computer Science degrees. We report our experience in jointly developing an open-source ebook for the introductory course, and a series of open educational resources for both the introductory and advanced networking courses. These ensure students actively engage with the course materials, through a hands-on approach; and scale to the larger classrooms and limited teaching staff, by leveraging open-source resources and an automated grading platform to provide feedback. We evaluate the impact of these pedagogical innovations by surveying the students, who indicated that these were helpful for them to master the course materials.},

Most of the practical use of this paper is to reference larger scale free textbooks for each of the listed sections, making a pool of resources for students to use and learn from the listed authors. The paper also dives deeper into the overarching topics professors should be covering, such as Learning protocols by dissecting packets, running virtual labs, implementing a simple transport protocol, and much more.}

abstract = {We propose moving from Software Defined Networks (SDN) to Software Managed Networks (SMN) where all information for managing the life cycle of a network (from deployment to operations to upgrades), across all layers (from Layer 1 through 7) is stored in a central repository. Crucially, a SMN also has a generalized control plane that, unlike SDN, controls all aspects of the cloud including traffic management (e.g., capacity planning) and reliability (e.g., incident routing) at both short (minutes) and large (years) time scales. Just as SDN allows better routing, a SMN improves visibility and enables cross-layer optimizations for faster response to failures and better network planning and operations. Implemented naively, SMN for planetary sc6ale networks requires orders of magnitude larger and more heterogeneous data (e.g., alerts, logs) than SDN. We address this using coarsening — mapping complex data to a more compact abstract representation that has approximately the same effect, and is more scalable, maintainable, and learnable. We show examples including Coarse Bandwidth Logs for capacity planning and Coarse Dependency Graphs for incident routing. Coarse Dependency Graphs improve an incident routing metric from 45\% to 78\% while for a distributed approach like Scouts the same metric was 22\%. We end by discussing how to realize SMN, and suggest cross-layer optimizations and coarsenings for other operational and planning problems in networks.},

It gives examples for the weaknesses of Siloed Network management (A practice where work is divided up by working on different TCP/IP layers) and how SDNs still do not allow for the best management of all layers. It continues into the deeper workings of SMNs via Coarsening (The idea of mapping complex data to a more compact and abstract representation that has approximately the same effect.)}

abstract = {Routers are the core building block of the Internet infrastructure. Maintaining a secure router deployment is critical for protecting networks and providing uninterrupted, smooth operation. In this work, we take a first step toward analyzing routers' security on the Internet. We focus on the potential attack surface for routers, i.e., publicly exposed services. Specifically, we investigate what services are commonly running on known router IPv4 addresses. While exposed services may not pose an immediate risk, they do highlight failure to follow best practices, e.g., strict access control lists. We found that more than 40\% of known router IPv4 addresses have at least one public-facing service. We also highlight the lack of consistency in applying network-wide security policies.},

They focus on IPv4 address for this paper, but plan to re-examine current findings and look into the status of IPv6. }
